# **Mini Group Assignment**

Luis Cruz and Nelson Guevara

**SoFi Stadium Impacts on Inglewood**: [Initial Proposal](https://github.com/nelsonguevara95/206a_group_project/tree/main/Group%20Assignments)

**Roles:**

Both of us will be analyzing data and creating similar reports from two different years to compare the differences in Inglewood after the development of SoFi stadium.

**Status Update:**

After our last meeting, it seems like the analysis we were trying to conduct was not as in-depth because we were using census data. We have since considered adjusting the framework to explore how property values can help indicate potential at-risk properties. At-risk properties are properties that have low improvement values compared to land values. Developers see this as an opportunity to redevelop these properties in hopes of  a profit either through market rate housing or new businesses. This means that previous businesses and/or residents that cannot afford new rents/costs are potentially being displaced. A way of looking at these changes is by comparing the building footprint of Inglewood prior to the developmet of SoFi stadium, and after.

**Data Update:** 

Luis found LA County Assessor parcel data that allows us to return to our initial location of study, Inglewood. We will be using that data to compare various factors that could influence displacement such as looking at the building footprint in 2010 and 2020, and comparing land and improvement values for those two respective years.

**Concerns:** 

I think our major concern is being able to map plot CSV data. Nelson has had issues in the first few weeks trying to use CSV data to create maps. The LA County Assessor data is in CSV format so we hope to learn and get comfortable with mapping CSV data.
