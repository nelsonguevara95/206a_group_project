# PROJECT PROPOSAL

## Introduction
Historically, there has been an association between the development of sports stadiums and the physical and social impacts that these projects have on the immediate community. We acknowledge that the construction of stadiums is not the sole factor for these impacts, but we understand that it does contribute to these impacts and facilitates other potential factors. For our research project, we look at the physical and social impact that the recently developed SoFi Stadium has produced on the city of Inglewood and its residents. Our research question is the following: 

*What are the physical and social changes that the City of Inglewood has experienced after the Development of SoFi stadium?*

## Why it is Important to Us, Why it Matters to Others, and What is at Stake

  It is important because there is currently another project in the works to develop the Intuit Dome in the upcoming years. The Intuit Dome is planned to be near Sofi Stadium, which opened its doors last year. The impacts of Sofi stadium are still ongoing and will continue to be felt over the next few years; therefore, it is essential to understand just how detrimental the burden (or not) is to community members. It should also matter to others because these development projects open the door for new businesses and new demographics that can afford higher rents and higher costs of living. The current lives and livelihoods of the residents of Inglewood are at stake due to projects like Sofi Stadium. If residents cannot afford the increased rents, small local businesses cannot afford the higher commercial rents, and people are forced to find new places to live and work in - the idea of development would simply be counterintuitive.  

## Spatial Scope Description

  We will be positioning Sofi Stadium as the center core of our spatial analysis. We will be referring to this center as it relates to its impacts on the immediate vicinity and neighborhood in the city of Inglewood. We will use that point to examine this stadium's effects on the primary nearby areas and at the expanding periphery. At the midpoint of this research we aim to have the physcial characteristics of the City in two different years, and also establishing current demographic profiles for the City. After this, our spatial analysis will dive in deeper to other potential factors that are not strictly physical and more social. Factors such as property values in the compares years and demographic changes between the ten year span. 

## Why space and/or time matters for this Project

  The cost of living is at an all-time high, with housing costs in California continuing to rise. The demand for housing and, more specifically, affordable housing is of immediate urgency as the county of Los Angeles deals with a deficit in available, affordable housing. Space and time will help us visually see physical changes but also help us see the makeup of the various census tracts in Inglewood and see how those two change over a the period of time we select to analyze.
  
## Preliminary Description of Data Sources

* ###### [LA County Assessor Parcel Data](https://data.lacounty.gov/Parcel-/Assessor-Parcels-Data-2006-thru-2021/9trm-uz8i/data#revert)
  * Wen filtered it gives us data such as building type/use and land/improvement value of those buildings in the City of Inglewood. The data is from 2006 to 2020 so it allows us to take the comparison approach.
  * Using decennial to compare previous census data prior to the development of SoFi Stadium
* ###### [Census Reporter Demographics: Income](https://censusreporter.org/data/map/?table=B19001&geo_ids=16000US0636546,140|16000US0636546&primary_geo_id=16000US0636546#column|B19001005,sumlev|140) 
  * This Census Reporter Data allows us to create income profiles and establish them for two points in time for comparison in the final project. 

## Scope of Intended Analysis and Resulting Visualizations for the Project

  The intended analysis looks at the impact that the development project has on the community, such as: Who gets to stay and live in these places, and what that population looks like (demographics). It also intends to highlight any changes in the physical environemnt such as the types of buildings operating near SoFi Stadium currently and comparing that to a past building footprint. Lastly, we would dive deeper into the aprcel data to look more closely at other factors that drive development such as the value of properties.

## Insights we Expect to Gain from this Research

  We will have a better understanding of the impact that Stadium developments have on the people in the community. These may be great projects from the lens of economic growth, but this research intends to find whethers it comes as a cost or benefit to community members. Using GIS will allow us to visually illustrate the impacts of these developments in the City of Inglewood. Based on these impacts, we can recommend more inclusionary development tactics to mitigate the adverse effects of stadium development projects.
