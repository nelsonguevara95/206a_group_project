# PROJECT PROPOSAL

## Introduction

  Historically, there has been an association between the development of sports stadiums and the social and economic impacts these projects have on the immediate community. We acknowledge that the construction of stadiums is not the sole factor for these impacts, but we also realize that it does contribute to these impacts and facilitates other potential factors. For our research project, we look at the economic and social impact that SoFi Stadium has produced on the City of Inglewood and its residents. Our research question is the following:
  
  *What are the social & economic impacts that the development of SoFi Stadium has had on the city of Inglewood?*

## Why it is Important to Us, why it Matters to Others, and What is at Stake

  It is important because there is currently another project in the works to develop the Intuit Dome in the upcoming years. The Intuit Dome is planned to be near Sofi Stadium, which opened its doors last year. The impacts of Sofi stadium are still ongoing and will continue to be documented over the next few years potentially; therefore, it is essential to understand just how detrimental the burden is to community members. It should also matter to others because these development projects also open the door for new businesses and new demographics that can afford the higher rents and higher costs of living. The current lives and livelihoods of the residents of Inglewood are at stake due to projects like Sofi Stadium. Residents cannot afford the increased rents, small local businesses cannot afford the higher commercial rents, and people are forced to find new places to live and work in.  

## Spatial Scope Description

  We will be positioning Sofi Stadium as the center core of our spatial analysis. We will be referring to this center as it relates to its impacts on the immediate vicinity and neighborhood in the city of Inglewood. We will use that point to examine this stadium's effects on the primary nearby areas and at the expanding periphery. We will also be looking at one more control location that does not have a stadium development occurring in it. 

## Why space and/or time matters for this Project

  The cost of living is at an all-time high, with housing costs in California continuing to rise. The demand for housing and, more specifically, affordable housing is of immediate urgency as the county of Los Angeles deals with a deficit in available, affordable housing. Alternative uses of land development could help remedy these issues. Stadium developments are taking up spaces that could've been used to help resolve housing demand and taking up resources from county and city budgets. 

## Preliminary Description of Data Sources

* ###### [Decennial Census](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=inglewood%20demographics&g=1600000US0636546&tid=ACSDP1Y2010.DP05) (in order to use the census data we would need to define the tracts) 
  * Give us population demographics (race, SES, education, age groups etc.) & property value information
  * Using decennial to compare previous census data prior to the development of SoFi Stadium
* ###### [City Boundaries](https://egis-lacounty.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/city-boundaries-lines/explore?location=33.950765%2C-118.332525%2C13.00) 
  * Geo Jason file containing the outlining of the city of Inglewood and its surrounding neighborhood cities and areas. We will use this data to define the boundaries of the demographic characteristics being described by the census data. 

## Scope of Intended Analysis and Resulting Visualizations for the Project

  The intended analysis looks at the impact that the development project has on the community, such as: Who gets to stay and live in these places, and what that population looks like. What types of jobs are coming in, and what kind are fleeing. The culture and character of the neighborhood and its amenities. 

  We would be presenting the changes visually within those aspects of community life between now and before the development of the stadium, maybe through the use of a choropleth map. 

## Insights we Expect to Gain from this Research

  We will have a better understanding of the impact that Stadium developments have on the people in the community. These may be great projects from the lens of economic growth, but this research will show us that it is at the expense of community members. Using GIS will allow us to visually illustrate the impacts of these developments in the City of Inglewood. Based on these impacts, we can recommend more inclusionary development tactics to mitigate the adverse effects of stadium development projects.
